Summary:
Machine learning presentation clustering 5k stocks on 50 indicators to improve portfolio
Cluster analysis is used as a multivariate analytical method, to identify the best stocks based on indicators to make a portfolio. Clustering also helps diversify a portfolio. I also considered high earners who show possible signs of weakness and vice versa.

Details:
- Presentation visualizing data from thousands of stocks in gathered using TD Ameritrade's API.
- Performed industry research to target algorithms, optimizing interpretability, performance, and precedence.
- Preprocessed data using industry standards
- Used imputation to handle missing values in the dataset
- Utilized machine learning on earnings data from thousands of stocks to cluster them into groups based on earnings with 70% accuracy.
- Structured the data to identify outstanding growth opportunities.
- Extracted data from Pandas database and performed exploratory data analysis and interpreted data using statistical models in Sklearn, and provided report to help the team understand the info data, prepared dataset for the model building
- Developed machine learning models and statistical models to manage risk and find growth opportunities.
